Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

i = 2
sum = 0
power = 5
digits = 1

until digits > 9**power*(digits.to_s.length)#finds the upper limit for our loop - the sum of the powers grows linearly with increasing digits while the number itself grows expoentially.
	digits *= 10
end

digits = digits.to_s.length - 1#

max = digits * 9**power

while i < max
	numarr = i.to_s.chars.map(&:to_i)
	
	powersum = 0
	
	numarr.each do |a|#loop through each digit and raise it to power and add to sum
		powersum += a**power
	end
	
	if i == powersum#check if the sum of powers of digits equals the number
		sum += i
	end
	i += 1
end

puts("The sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of the #{power}th powers of their digits is #{sum}")
