Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

maxspiral = 1001
spiralsize = 1
currmax = 1#currmax will hold the maximum value on the spiral at any time. This will be the value in the top right corner.
spiralsum = 1#we will begin with a 1x1 "spiral" and progressively add loops to it

while spiralsize < maxspiral
	spiralsum += (currmax*4 + (spiralsize+1)*10)#the corners are given by (in clockwise order starting at bottom right) currmax + (spiralsize+1), currmax + (spiralsize+1)*3, currmax + (spiralsize+1)*2, currmax + (spiralsize+1)*4
	currmax = currmax + (spiralsize+1)*4
	spiralsize += 2
end

puts("The sum of the diagonals of a #{maxspiral}x#{maxspiral} spiral is given by #{spiralsum}")
